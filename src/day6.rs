//! --- Day 6: Memory Reallocation ---
//!
//! A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation
//! routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.
//!
//! In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks.
//! The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.
//!
//! The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the
//! most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among
//! the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the
//! next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it
//! runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.
//!
//! The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks
//! configuration is produced that has been seen before.
//!
//! For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:
//!
//! - The banks start with `0`, `2`, `7`, and `0` blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is
//! chosen for redistribution.
//! - Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the
//! second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first,
//! and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks
//! like this: `2 4 1 2`.
//! - Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are
//! four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: `3 1 2 3`.
//! - Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three
//! blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other
//! three banks, leaving it with none: `0 2 3 4`.
//! - The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four
//! banks receives one: `1 3 4 1`.
//! - The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: `2 4 1 2`.
//!
//! At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: `2 4 1 2` was already seen. The
//! infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this
//! example is 5.
//!
//! Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be
//! completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?
